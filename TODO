lists, literals and quoted names = LLQ

Rewrite parser combinator to only LLQ

Rework eval function to take LLQ and turn it into s-Expressions

Rework macro expand to not do double translations
In macro expand, check that return value of the macro function is an LLQ (it must be serializable)

Macro expand >should< have access to the defined functions in the scope its created in. (?)
That way you can easily use macros to do things?
